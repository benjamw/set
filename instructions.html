	<h1>Instructions</h1>

	<h2>How to Play</h2>

	<p>When you find a set, click on the cards in that set, and they will
	be highlighted, and if the set is valid, they will be removed from the
	group and replaced with new cards from the deck.</p>

	<p>If the set is invalid, an error will show and the cards will not be
	removed.</p>

	<p>If there are no sets in the group, click on the 'No Sets' button
	and if you are correct, three more cards will be added to the group.
	If you are wrong, then an error will show and no cards will be added.</p>

	<p>If there are more than 12 cards in the group and you find a set,
	no new cards will be added, instead, the remainder of the cards will be
	integrated into the main group until you have only 12 cards in the group.</p>

	<h2>Object of the game</h2>

	<p>The object of the game is to find sets in the group of cards that
	form a set by having all attributes different, or some of the attributes
	different, and some of them the same.</p>

	<p>An attribute is one of: color, number, shape, fill</p>

	<p>An example of a set would be something like:<br />
	<img class="example" src="cards/01.gif" alt="1 red solid squiggle" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/02.gif" alt="2 red solid squiggles" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/03.gif" alt="3 red solid squiggles" /><br />
	where they are all red, they all have the same shape, they all have a
	solid fill, and all have different numbers (1, 2, 3, respectively)</p>

	<p>Another example of a set would be:<br />
	<img class="example" src="cards/63.gif" alt="3 green hollow squiggles" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/10.gif" alt="1 red solid diamond" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/50.gif" alt="2 purple striped ovals" /><br />
	where they all have a different color (green, red, purple), they all
	have a different shape (squiggle, diamond, oval), they all have a
	different fill (hollow, solid, striped), and they all have a different
	number (3, 1, 2)</p>

	<p>An example of an incorrect set would be:<br />
	<img class="example" src="cards/46.gif" alt="1 red striped oval" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/44.gif" alt="2 green striped diamonds" />
	<img class="example" src="cards/51.gif" alt="3 purple striped ovals" /><br />
	where the reason they are incorrect is that one of them is a diamond,
	and the other two aren't</p>
